# Smart Arduino Blind Stick (SABS)
An affordable, multifunctional assistive device for visually impaired individuals, integrating obstacle detection, object identification, water hazard sensing, GPS navigation, camera-based object detection, voice output, and an emergency button.
Here's a detailed README file for your Smart Arduino Blind Stick (SABS) project:

## Features

- Obstacle Detection: Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in the user's path and provides real-time feedback.
- Object Identification: Employs a camera module and computer vision algorithms to identify objects in the environment.
- Water Hazard Sensing: Incorporates a water level sensor to detect potential water hazards and alert the user.
- GPS Navigation: Uses a GPS module to assist users in navigation, providing auditory directions.
- Voice Output: Provides voice feedback for detected obstacles, identified objects, and navigation instructions.
- Emergency Button: Allows users to signal for help in case of emergencies by triggering an alarm or sending a distress signal.

## Hardware Components

- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- Water Level Sensor
- GPS Module
- Camera Module
- Buzzer
- Emergency Button

## Software Development
